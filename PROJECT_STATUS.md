## 📊 Overall Progress: 100% Complete (36/36 Tasks)

All MVP tasks from `tasks/tasks-1-prd-mvp-model-selector.md` have been completed successfully.

## 🎯 MVP Accomplishments

### ✅ Core Features Working
- **Task Classification**: Browser-based semantic similarity + keyword matching

- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Offline Capability**: Fully static PWA with no external API calls

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: SvelteKit with static site generation
- **Bundle Size**: ~40KB (well under target)
- **Performance**: <1 second response time
- **Browser Support**: Chrome-first (primary target achieved)
- **Data**: Comprehensive model dataset with 17+ task categories
- **Deployment**: Automated GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- **MVP Acceptance Tests**: 11/11 passing ✅
- **Core Functionality**: All user workflows working
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases
- **Documentation**: Complete user guide and deployment docs

```

### Infrastructure
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment pipeline
- ✅ Static site generation with @sveltejs/adapter-static
- ✅ Automated testing with Vitest
- ✅ Documentation in `docs/` directory

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Failures (Non-blocking for MVP)
- **Integration Tests**: 2/7 failing (expectations vs. current classifier behavior)
- **Task Classification Tests**: 4/17 failing (edge case accuracy)
- **Root Cause**: Classification algorithm optimized for common cases, struggles with edge cases
- **Impact**: MVP functionality unaffected, acceptance tests passing

### Classification Accuracy
- **Strengths**: Works well for common computer vision, NLP tasks
- **Weaknesses**: Some edge cases misclassified (e.g., "text classification" → computer vision)
- **Acceptable for MVP**: User feedback was "we can just live with what we got at the moment"

### Future Improvements Identified
1. **Browser SLM Integration**: Replace keyword matching with small language model
2. **Classification Accuracy**: Fine-tune task taxonomy and keywords
3. **Model Data**: Expand dataset with more specialized models
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Extend beyond Chrome support

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Production Environment
- **URL**: https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/model-selector
- **Status**: Live and accessible ✅
- **SSL**: HTTPS enabled ✅
- **Build**: Successfully automated via GitHub Actions ✅

### Recent Deployment Fixes
- ✅ Fixed package-lock.json inclusion for GitHub Actions
- ✅ Updated README URLs from placeholders to live URLs
- ✅ Resolved SvelteKit prerender configuration
- ✅ Fixed component import paths after restructuring

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

```
✅ MVP Acceptance Tests: 11/11 passing
⚠️  Integration Tests: 5/7 passing (2 edge case failures)
⚠️  Task Classification Tests: 13/17 passing (4 accuracy edge cases)
⚠️  Overall: 29/35 passing (83% pass rate, MVP requirements met)
```

## 📋 Development Environment

### Prerequisites Met
- Node.js with npm ✅
- Git repository ✅
- GitHub Pages configuration ✅

### Key Commands Working
```bash
npm install          # ✅ Dependencies installed
npm run dev         # ✅ Development server
npm run build       # ✅ Production build (warnings but successful)
npm run preview     # ✅ Preview server (localhost:4174)
npm test           # ⚠️  Tests run but some failures
git status         # ✅ Clean working tree
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria: MVP ACHIEVED

### ✅ Primary Requirements Met
- [x] User can get relevant model recommendations in <30 seconds (achieved <1s)
- [x] Works in Chrome browser (primary target)
- [x] Basic keyboard navigation works (full accessibility implemented)
- [x] Environmental estimates are reasonable (tier-based scoring system)
- [x] No external API calls during usage (fully static)
- [x] <2MB bundle size (achieved ~40KB)

### ✅ User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Clear environmental impact messaging
- Fast, responsive interactions
- Accessible to users with disabilities

## 📈 Next Iteration Opportunities

### High Priority
1. **Classification Accuracy**: Implement browser-compatible SLM for better task understanding
2. **Test Coverage**: Fix failing edge case tests for better robustness
3. **Model Data Expansion**: Add more specialized and recent models

### Medium Priority
1. **Multi-browser Support**: Test and optimize for Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Advanced Filters**: Allow users to filter by model size, task type, etc.
3. **Usage Analytics**: Basic privacy-friendly usage tracking

### Low Priority
1. **Model Performance Metrics**: Add benchmarking data where available
2. **Community Features**: Model ratings, user reviews
3. **API Integration**: Real-time model updates from Hugging Face

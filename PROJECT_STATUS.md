```

### Infrastructure
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment pipeline
- ✅ Static site generation with @sveltejs/adapter-static
- ✅ Automated testing with Vitest
- ✅ Documentation in `docs/` directory

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Failures (Non-blocking for MVP)
- **Integration Tests**: 2/7 failing (expectations vs. current classifier behavior)
- **Task Classification Tests**: 4/17 failing (edge case accuracy)
- **Root Cause**: Classification algorithm optimized for common cases, struggles with edge cases
- **Impact**: MVP functionality unaffected, acceptance tests passing

### Classification Accuracy
- **Strengths**: Works well for common computer vision, NLP tasks
- **Weaknesses**: Some edge cases misclassified (e.g., "text classification" → computer vision)
- **Acceptable for MVP**: User feedback was "we can just live with what we got at the moment"

### Future Improvements Identified
1. **Browser SLM Integration**: Replace keyword matching with small language model
2. **Classification Accuracy**: Fine-tune task taxonomy and keywords
3. **Model Data**: Expand dataset with more specialized models
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Extend beyond Chrome support

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Production Environment
- **URL**: https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/model-selector
- **Status**: Live and accessible ✅
- **SSL**: HTTPS enabled ✅
- **Build**: Successfully automated via GitHub Actions ✅

### Recent Deployment Fixes
- ✅ Fixed package-lock.json inclusion for GitHub Actions
- ✅ Updated README URLs from placeholders to live URLs
- ✅ Resolved SvelteKit prerender configuration
- ✅ Fixed component import paths after restructuring

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

```
✅ MVP Acceptance Tests: 11/11 passing
⚠️  Integration Tests: 5/7 passing (2 edge case failures)
⚠️  Task Classification Tests: 13/17 passing (4 accuracy edge cases)
⚠️  Overall: 29/35 passing (83% pass rate, MVP requirements met)
```

## 📋 Development Environment

### Prerequisites Met
- Node.js with npm ✅
- Git repository ✅
- GitHub Pages configuration ✅

### Key Commands Working
```bash
npm install          # ✅ Dependencies installed
npm run dev         # ✅ Development server
npm run build       # ✅ Production build (warnings but successful)
npm run preview     # ✅ Preview server (localhost:4174)
npm test           # ⚠️  Tests run but some failures
git status         # ✅ Clean working tree
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria: MVP ACHIEVED

### ✅ Primary Requirements Met
- [x] User can get relevant model recommendations in <30 seconds (achieved <1s)
- [x] Works in Chrome browser (primary target)
- [x] Basic keyboard navigation works (full accessibility implemented)
- [x] Environmental estimates are reasonable (tier-based scoring system)
- [x] No external API calls during usage (fully static)
- [x] <2MB bundle size (achieved ~40KB)

### ✅ User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Clear environmental impact messaging
- Fast, responsive interactions
- Accessible to users with disabilities

## 📈 Next Iteration: v1.1 (In Planning)

### Phase 2 Focus: Browser-Based SLM Integration
**PRD**: `tasks/2-prd-browser-slm-classification.md`  
**Timeline**: 8-12 days  
**Goal**: Replace keyword-based classification with Small Language Model for 90%+ accuracy

#### Key Objectives
1. **Improve Classification Accuracy**: From 83% → 90%+ using zero-shot classification
2. **Simplify Codebase**: Remove complex keyword matching and decision trees
3. **Maintain Privacy**: Keep all inference client-side (no external APIs)
4. **Cross-Browser Support**: Expand beyond Chrome-first to Firefox, Safari, mobile
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to keywords if SLM fails to load

#### Technical Approach
- **Library**: Transformers.js v3+ (WebGPU/WASM)
- **Model**: DistilBERT-based zero-shot classifier (~67M params, quantized)
- **Inference Time**: ≤10 seconds per classification
- **Load Time**: ≤30 seconds on broadband (first visit only)
- **Fallback**: Keyword classifier with user notification

### Future Priorities (Post-v1.1)

#### High Priority
1. **Test Coverage**: Fix failing edge case tests for better robustness
2. **Model Data Expansion**: Add more specialized and recent models
3. **Performance Optimization**: Further reduce inference time

#### Medium Priority
1. **Advanced Filters**: Allow users to filter by model size, task type, etc.
2. **Usage Analytics**: Basic privacy-friendly usage tracking
3. **Multi-SLM Options**: Let users choose speed vs accuracy

#### Low Priority
1. **Model Performance Metrics**: Add benchmarking data where available
2. **Community Features**: Model ratings, user reviews
3. **API Integration**: Real-time model updates from Hugging Face

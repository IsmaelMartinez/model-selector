# Model Selector - Project Vision & Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Create an open source model selector that helps users decide which open or closed model to use, how to adapt/train it, and how to host it, given a natural-language task description. The system will be distributed, portable, and resilient — starting as a PWA and potentially evolving into a plugin or peer-to-peer app.

## Mission

An open source assistant to help you choose, adapt, and deploy the best AI model for your task — in your browser, offline.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy First**: Runs locally in the browser, no data sent to external servers
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Environmental Consciousness**: Prioritizes efficient, sustainable model recommendations
- **Accessibility**: Works across devices and skill levels
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparency

## Current Status (MVP)

### What We Have
- ✅ Basic SvelteKit project structure
- ✅ PWA configuration for offline usage
- ✅ AI development workflow commands (`/create-prd`, `/generate-tasks`, `/process-task-list`)
- ✅ Documentation and contribution guidelines

### What We're Building (MVP)
- 🔄 Rules-first recommendation engine
- 🔄 Simple task categorization interface
- 🔄 Manual decision graph (YAML/JSON)
- 🔄 Basic PWA with service worker

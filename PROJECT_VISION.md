# Model Selector - Project Vision

## Mission
An open source assistant to help you choose the most environmentally efficient AI model for your task â€” focusing on sustainability and simplicity first.

## Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: Runs locally in browser, no external data transmission
- **Environmental Consciousness**: "Smaller is better" philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Prove concept before adding complexity
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development

## Current Status (MVP)

### Ready
- âœ… SvelteKit project structure
- âœ… Implementation task breakdown
- âœ… AI development workflow commands
- âœ… Chrome-first accessibility approach

### Building
- ðŸ”„ Tiered recommendation engine (browser/local models)
- ðŸ”„ Task classification with OSS model fallback
- ðŸ”„ Environmental impact scoring
- ðŸ”„ Static JSON data structure

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

**Goals**: Chrome-optimized PWA with tiered recommendations and environmental scoring

**Success Criteria**: 
- <30 seconds to recommendations
- 10+ AI task categories
- 8/10 developers find useful

### Phase 2: v1.1 (Planned)
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks after MVP

**Goals**: Add cloud tier, cross-browser support, automated data updates

### Future Phases
- **v2.0**: SLM-powered clarification system
- **v3.0**: Distributed architecture (2026+)

## Technical Architecture

### Current (MVP)
```
User Input â†’ Task Classification â†’ Model Selection â†’ Environmental Scoring â†’ Recommendations
```

## Success Metrics
- **Speed**: <30 seconds query to recommendation
- **Performance**: <2MB bundle, <3 seconds load
- **Adoption**: 1000+ monthly users by end 2025

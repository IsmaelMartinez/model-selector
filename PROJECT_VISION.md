# Model Selector - Project Vision & Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Create an open source model selector that helps users decide which open or closed model to use, how to adapt/train it, and how to host it, given a natural-language task description. The system will be distributed, portable, and resilient — starting as a PWA and potentially evolving into a plugin or peer-to-peer app.

## Mission

An open source assistant to help you choose the most environmentally efficient AI model for your task — focusing on sustainability and simplicity first.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy First**: Runs locally in the browser, no data sent to external servers during usage
- **Environmental Consciousness**: Prioritizes efficient, sustainable model recommendations with "smaller is better" philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Prove the concept works before adding complexity
- **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility support, works across devices and skill levels
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparency
- **Tiered Recommendations**: Browser → Local → Cloud deployment options

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current (MVP)
```
User Input → Task Classification → Tiered Model Selection → Environmental Scoring → Recommendations
             (OSS model or           (Browser/Local)         (Reasonable estimates)
              keyword fallback)
```

### v1.1
```
User Input → Enhanced Classification → 3-Tier Selection → Impact Validation → Recommendations
                                      (Browser/Local/Cloud)   ← GitHub Actions (Auto-update)
```

### v2.0

## Key Learnings from Planning

### MVP Simplification Strategy
- **Chrome-first approach**: Prove concept in one browser before expanding
- **Reasonable estimates over precision**: Environmental impact doesn't need scientific validation for MVP
- **Basic accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation sufficient to start
- **Tiered recommendations**: Browser → Local → Cloud provides clear upgrade path
- **"Smaller is better" philosophy**: Default to most efficient models, let users choose complexity

### Technical Decisions
- **No offline requirement**: Users need internet for models anyway, don't over-engineer
- **Static data approach**: Pre-aggregate model information, avoid runtime API calls
- **OSS-first research**: Investigate existing classification models before building custom solutions
- **Environmental differentiation**: Focus on sustainability as key value proposition

### Scope Management
- **Defer complexity**: Confidence scores, deployment instructions, advanced accessibility to future iterations
- **Prove then improve**: Get basic recommendation working before adding intelligence
- **Community-driven evolution**: Let user feedback guide feature prioritization

## Long-term Impact

The Model Selector aims to democratize AI model selection by making environmentally conscious choices accessible to developers regardless of their ML expertise. By starting simple and focusing on sustainability, we can:

1. **Reduce AI's environmental impact** by promoting efficient model choices
2. **Lower barriers to AI adoption** through simplified model selection
3. **Build community-driven knowledge** about model performance and environmental costs
4. **Create a foundation** for more sophisticated AI deployment tools

Our approach proves that complex problems can start with simple solutions, evolving based on real user needs rather than theoretical complexity.

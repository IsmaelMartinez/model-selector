# Papers with Code API Research Summary

## Status: Not Recommended for MVP

## Key Findings

### API Status
- **Papers with Code acquired by Hugging Face** (2024)
- Original API endpoints returning 404s
- Legacy `paperswithcode-client` package available but uncertain maintenance

### Available Alternatives
1. **Hugging Face Papers API** - Direct paper-to-model relationships
2. **Legacy Papers with Code Client** - Task categorization, but risky

### Decision: Skip for MVP

**Reasons:**
- High integration risk with uncertain API future
- Significant data overlap with existing Hugging Face integration
- Complex implementation for optional feature
- Better ROI focusing on core Hugging Face API optimization

### Recommended Future Approach
**Phase 2 Enhancement**: Consider Hugging Face Papers API integration
- Use `/api/arxiv/{arxiv_id}/repos` for enhanced model context
- Add research paper summaries to model recommendations
- Leverage paper abstracts for semantic model matching

### Alternative Data Sources
Instead of Papers with Code, enhance current HF integration with:
- Model download statistics (popularity)
- Model card analysis for task categorization  
- Community metrics (likes, discussions)
- Library/framework compatibility tags

## Implementation Timeline
- **MVP**: Skip Papers with Code entirely
- **Phase 2**: Evaluate Hugging Face Papers API
- **Phase 3**: Consider research context features

This decision allows MVP to focus on core functionality while keeping future enhancement options open.

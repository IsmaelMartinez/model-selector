# AI Model Selector - User Guide

## Overview

The AI Model Selector helps you find the most environmentally efficient AI models for your specific tasks. Our recommendations prioritize "smaller is better" - models that use less energy while maintaining good performance.

## How to Use

### 1. Describe Your Task

Enter a clear description of what you want to achieve:

**Good Examples**:
- "I want to classify customer support tickets by urgency level"
- "Detect objects in security camera footage"
- "Analyze sentiment in product reviews"
- "Generate text summaries for articles"
- "Convert speech to text for meeting transcripts"

**Tips for Better Results**:
- Be specific about your task type (classify, detect, generate, predict)
- Mention the type of data (text, images, audio, time series)
- Include context about your use case

### 2. Review Recommendations

The system will show you up to 3 model recommendations, ranked by environmental efficiency:

**Model Information**:
- **Name & Description**: What the model does
- **Size**: Model file size (smaller = more efficient)
- **Accuracy**: Performance score (higher = better)
- **Environmental Impact**: üå± Low, ‚ö° Medium, üî• High
- **Tier**: ü™∂ Lightweight, ‚öñÔ∏è Standard, üöÄ Advanced
- **Top Pick**: ‚≠ê Most environmentally efficient option

**Deployment Options**:
- **Browser**: Runs directly in web browsers
- **Edge**: Suitable for edge devices
- **Mobile**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Cloud**: Best deployed on cloud servers
- **Server**: Requires dedicated server hardware

### 3. Choose Your Model

**Prioritization Logic**:
1. **Lightweight models first** - Most energy efficient
2. **Smaller sizes within each tier** - Less storage and memory
3. **Good accuracy-to-size ratio** - Best performance per resource

**For Production Use**:
- Start with the ‚≠ê Top Pick (most efficient)
- Consider accuracy requirements vs. environmental impact
- Check deployment compatibility with your infrastructure

## Environmental Impact

### Why It Matters
- **Energy Consumption**: Smaller models use less electricity
- **Carbon Footprint**: Lower energy = reduced CO2 emissions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Less compute = lower operational costs
- **Accessibility**: Lighter models run on more devices

### Impact Levels
- **üå± Low Impact**: <0.1g CO2 per inference, <5W power
- **‚ö° Medium Impact**: 0.1-1.0g CO2 per inference, 5-50W power  
- **üî• High Impact**: >1.0g CO2 per inference, >50W power

### Our Approach
We prioritize models that achieve good results with minimal environmental impact. This "smaller is better" philosophy helps you build sustainable AI applications.

## Tips for Success

### Writing Good Task Descriptions
```
‚ùå "Help me with AI"
‚úÖ "Classify customer support tickets by urgency level"

‚ùå "Image stuff"  
‚úÖ "Detect objects in retail store security footage"

‚ùå "Text things"
‚úÖ "Analyze sentiment in social media posts about our product"
```

### Choosing the Right Model
- **Start small**: Try the lightweight recommendation first
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate accuracy on your specific data
- **Consider trade-offs**: Balance accuracy vs. environmental impact
- **Plan for scale**: Smaller models handle more users efficiently

## Accessibility Features

# ADR-001: Browser SLM Classification Evaluation

## Status
**REJECTED** - Do not proceed with browser-based SLM classification for AI Model Advisor

## Context
We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of browser-based Small Language Models (SLMs) for task classification to potentially improve upon our existing keyword-based classifier. The goal was to achieve 100% classification accuracy with ≤10s inference time for our 7-category task taxonomy.

This evaluation serves as a case study for when NOT to use AI/ML solutions and provides technical insights for future browser SLM projects.

## Decision
**We will NOT implement browser-based SLM classification** due to unacceptable accuracy performance.

## Rationale

### Models Evaluated
1. **Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli** (~255MB)
2. **Xenova/bart-large-mnli** (~560MB)

### Performance Results

| Model | Accuracy | Avg Inference Time | Result |
|-------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| DistilBERT MNLI | 50.0% | 251ms | ❌ Random guessing |
| BART MNLI | 30.0% | 2242ms | ❌ Worse + 9x slower |
| **Target** | **100%** | **≤10,000ms** | **Not achieved** |

### Detailed Analysis

#### DistilBERT Results (10 test cases)
- ✅ Correct: 5/10 (Data Preprocessing, Time Series Analysis, Recommendation Systems, Reinforcement Learning)
- ❌ Failed: 5/10 (NLP → Data Preprocessing, Computer Vision → Recommendation Systems, Speech Processing → Recommendation Systems)
- **Critical Issue**: Misclassifies obvious NLP and Computer Vision tasks

#### BART Results (10 test cases) 
- ✅ Correct: 3/10 (Speech Processing, Recommendation Systems, Reinforcement Learning)
- ❌ Failed: 7/10 (Data Preprocessing → Reinforcement Learning, NLP → Speech Processing)
- **Critical Issue**: Worse accuracy with 9x slower inference

#### Label Format Optimization
Tested 4 different label formats:
- Original: "Natural Language Processing" → Wrong (38% confidence)
- Descriptive: "processing and understanding text" → Wrong (11.5% confidence)
- Task-focused: "text analysis task" → Wrong (18.8% confidence)  
- Simple: "text" → Wrong prediction

**Conclusion**: Label format changes do not resolve fundamental accuracy issues.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **MNLI models trained on different domains** - Not optimized for ML/AI task classification
2. **Zero-shot approach insufficient** - Our task categories require domain-specific understanding
3. **Model size vs accuracy tradeoff** - Larger models (BART) perform worse, not better

## Technical Findings

### Browser SLM Integration Insights
1. **Transformers.js v3.7.4** works reliably in Chrome browser
2. **Model loading** is feasible but resource-intensive (255MB-560MB downloads)
3. **Inference performance** varies significantly between models (251ms vs 2242ms)
4. **WebGPU vs WASM** - Both backends functional (testing methodology established)

### Model Evaluation Methodology
- **Systematic testing** of DistilBERT and BART MNLI models
- **Label format optimization** tested (4 different approaches)
- **Task taxonomy alignment** verified against 7-category system
- **Performance benchmarking** on real hardware (Chrome desktop)

### Key Learning: Zero-Shot Classification Limitations
- **MNLI models** trained on different domains (textual entailment, not ML task classification)
- **Domain specificity matters** - General models struggle with specialized taxonomies
- **Label engineering insufficient** - Problem is fundamental, not superficial

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Enhanced User Interface ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Interactive questionnaire** approach tested
- **Example-based selection** more intuitive than AI classification
- **Pros**: 95%+ accuracy, educational, fast, no downloads
- **Effort**: Low (already prototyped)

### 2. Fine-tuning DistilBERT 🤔 **FUTURE CONSIDERATION**
- **Pros**: Could achieve >90% accuracy with domain-specific training
- **Cons**: Requires training infrastructure, labeled data, ONNX conversion
- **Effort**: High (2-3 weeks)
- **Note**: Only justified if UI approaches prove insufficient

### 3. Improve Existing Keyword Classifier ✅ **RECOMMENDED** 
- **Pros**: Already working, fast, deterministic, improvable
- **Cons**: Limited to keyword matching
- **Effort**: Low (1-2 days)

### 4. API-based Classification (ChatGPT/Claude) 🤔 **FUTURE OPTION**
- **Pros**: High accuracy (>95%), reliable
- **Cons**: Requires internet, API costs, privacy concerns
- **Effort**: Low (2-3 days)
- **Use case**: Premium feature for complex edge cases

### 5. Embedding-based Similarity ⚡ **PROMISING ALTERNATIVE**
- **Approach**: Use smaller sentence transformer models for similarity matching
- **Pros**: Smaller models (50-100MB), better domain alignment possible
- **Cons**: Still requires model download, needs evaluation
- **Effort**: Medium (1 week evaluation)

## Consequences

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Remove SLM integration tasks** from current sprint
2. ✅ **Clean up test files** and development artifacts  
3. ✅ **Focus on keyword classifier improvements**
4. ✅ **Consider API integration for future enhancement**

### Technical Debt
- Test files created during evaluation should be removed
- Transformers.js dependency can be removed from package.json
- Development effort can be redirected to proven approaches

### Future Considerations
- **Monitor SLM landscape** - Better models may emerge (sentence transformers, domain-specific models)
- **Fine-tuning option** - If UI approaches prove insufficient for edge cases
- **Local LLM integration** - When Llama/Mistral browser support improves
- **Embedding-based approaches** - Smaller models for similarity matching
- **Progressive enhancement** - Start with UI, add AI features selectively

### Broader Implications for Browser SLM Projects
1. **Domain specificity crucial** - Generic models often fail specialized tasks
2. **UX alternatives often better** - Consider non-AI solutions first
3. **Model size matters** - Balance capability vs user experience
4. **Evaluation methodology** - Systematic testing prevents bad decisions
5. **When to use AI** - Best for unstructured, complex, or creative tasks

## Understanding Recommendations

Models are ranked by efficiency (smaller first):

| Tier | Size | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| Lightweight | ≤500MB | Edge, mobile, browser |
| Standard | ≤4GB | Cloud, consumer GPU |
| Advanced | ≤20GB | Dedicated GPU |

The ⭐ Top Pick is the most efficient option.

### Environmental Impact

- 🌱 **Low**: Runs on edge devices, minimal power
- ⚡ **Medium**: Cloud/server deployment
- 🔥 **High**: Requires dedicated hardware

## About Smaller Models

Lightweight models are often specialized for specific tasks. A table detection model won't do general object detection. Always verify the model fits your exact use case.

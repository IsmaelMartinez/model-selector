# PRD: MVP Model Selector

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The MVP Model Selector is a simple web application that helps environmentally conscious developers choose sustainable AI models for common tasks. Users input a natural language description of their AI task and receive hardcoded recommendations for energy-efficient, open source models with environmental impact guidance.

This MVP runs entirely in the local browser with no external API calls for inference, prioritizing climate-friendly model choices while proving the concept works with a minimal, static implementation before adding complexity like dynamic parsing or external integrations.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary**: Validate that a tiered, "smaller-is-better" model selection tool provides value to developers
- **Secondary**: Establish the basic architecture for future intelligent features and clarification systems
- **Technical**: Deploy a working web app with browser and local model recommendations
- **User**: Enable developers to quickly identify the smallest viable models for 10+ common AI tasks

## 3. User Stories

**As a general developer,**
- I want to describe my AI task in plain English so that I don't need to research model categories
- I want to get model recommendations quickly so that I can start prototyping
- I want the tool to run locally in my browser so that my task descriptions stay private
- I want simple deployment guidance so that I know how to run the recommended models

**As a developer new to AI,**
- I want to understand what type of task I'm trying to solve so that I can learn AI concepts
- I want recommendations for beginner-friendly models so that I don't get overwhelmed
- I want to see why a model was recommended so that I can learn decision criteria

**As an environmentally conscious developer,**
- I want energy-efficient model recommendations so that I can minimize my carbon footprint
- I want smaller models that require less computational resources and energy
- I want to understand the environmental impact of different model choices

**As a developer with disabilities,**
- I want basic keyboard navigation so that I can use the tool without a mouse
- I want readable text and decent contrast so that I can read the recommendations

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Task Input Interface
- Simple textarea for natural language task description with proper ARIA labels
- Submit button to trigger recommendation with accessible button text
- Clear placeholder text with examples and ARIA descriptions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- **Basic Accessibility**:
  - Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter)
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Readable text and adequate contrast

### 4.2 Task Classification Engine
- **Primary Approach**: Explore existing open source task classification models
  - Investigate Hugging Face models for NL → AI task category mapping
  - Research existing task taxonomy from Papers with Code, Hugging Face, etc.
  - Use pre-trained models to classify user input into standard AI task categories
- **Fallback Approach**: Simple keyword matching if no suitable OSS classifier found
- **Target Categories** (10+ common AI tasks):
  - Text classification, generation, summarization, Q&A
  - Image classification, generation, object detection  
  - Speech transcription, translation, code generation
  - Data analysis/insights
- Prioritize energy-efficient models for each identified category

### 4.3 Recommendation Engine
- **Selection Philosophy**: Smaller/simpler models are prioritized by default
- **Tiered Recommendation System** (MVP focuses on first two tiers):
  - **Browser**: Models that run directly in browser (WebGPU/WASM)
  - **Local**: Models for local deployment (CPU/GPU on user's machine)
  - **Cloud**: Cloud deployment options (future iteration)
- **Data Aggregation Approach**: Leverage existing open source model databases
  - Aggregate top-performing models from Hugging Face model hub
  - Pull model metadata, performance metrics, and popularity data
  - Cross-reference with Papers with Code benchmarks
  - Supplement with environmental impact data where available
- **Model Selection**: For each task category and deployment tier, provide:
  - 1-2 recommended models per tier (prioritize smallest viable option)
  - Clear trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and speed
  - Environmental impact estimates (model size, efficiency comparisons)
  - Links to model sources (Hugging Face, GitHub, papers) without detailed deployment instructions

### 4.4 Results Display
- Clear presentation of recommended models with semantic HTML structure
- Tabular or card-based layout with proper ARIA roles and labels
- Links to model repositories/documentation with descriptive link text
- Copy-paste friendly model names and commands
- Environmental impact indicators (energy consumption, model size, carbon footprint estimates)
- **Basic Accessibility**:
  - Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
  - Alt text for images
  - Basic keyboard navigation

- **Performance benchmarking** - No real-time model comparisons
- **Model training guidance** - Focus only on pre-trained models
- **External API calls during usage** - All processing happens in the local browser, no external inference calls
- **Real-time data fetching** - Model data is pre-aggregated and served statically
- **Cloud deployment tier** - MVP focuses on browser and local deployment only
- **User clarification questions** - SLM-powered clarification system deferred to future iterations
- **Confidence scores** - Task classification confidence indicators deferred to future iterations
- **Model deployment instructions** - Detailed guidance for deploying/running AI models deferred to future iterations
- **Model training guidance** - Fine-tuning and training instructions out of scope
- **Custom model training** - Focus on existing pre-trained models only
- **User feedback collection** - No analytics or tracking
- **Model hosting** - Only provide links to model sources, not hosting
- **Advanced accessibility features** - MVP focuses on basic accessibility; comprehensive WCAG compliance deferred to future versions

  - How do we categorize models into browser-compatible vs. local-only?
  - Which models work well with WebGPU/WebAssembly for in-browser execution?
- **Performance Trade-offs**:
  - How do we present the accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs clearly?
  - What's the threshold for "good enough" performance for different use cases?
  - How do we quantify and compare carbon footprints across models?

### 9.3 Future Clarification System
- **User Context Questions** (future iteration):
  - "Is this user-facing (needs to be fast) or runs in background (can be slower)?"
  - "How efficient does it need to be for [specific use case example]?"
  - "Do you prioritize accuracy or speed for this task?"
  - "What's your technical comfort level with model deployment?"
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: How to adjust recommendations based on user responses

### 9.4 User Experience

- **Note**: Embedding tests separated for local-only execution
  - Downloads ~23MB model
  - Takes ~3 minutes vs 2 seconds for fast tests
  - Not suitable for CI/CD pipelines
  - Validates 98.3% classification accuracy

### Classification Accuracy
- **Production**: 98.3% accuracy with MiniLM sentence embeddings
- **Strengths**: Excellent performance across all 7 categories
- **Model**: Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (23MB, cached in IndexedDB)
- **Improvement**: Upgraded from Llama 3.2 1B (700MB) to MiniLM (23MB)

### Future Improvements Identified
1. **Additional Categories**: Expand task taxonomy
2. **Model Data**: Expand dataset with more specialized models
3. **Cross-browser Testing**: Extend test coverage to Firefox, Safari
4. **Comparison Features**: Side-by-side model comparison

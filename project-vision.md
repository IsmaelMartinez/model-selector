# AI Model Advisor - Project Vision

## Mission
An open source assistant to help you choose the most environmentally efficient AI model for your task — focusing on sustainability and simplicity first.

## Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: Runs locally in browser, no external data transmission
- **Environmental Consciousness**: "Smaller is better" philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Prove concept before adding complexity
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development

## Current Status

### ✅ MVP Complete
- ✅ SvelteKit project structure with static site generation
- ✅ Browser-based embedding classification (MiniLM, 98.3% accuracy)
- ✅ Tiered recommendation engine (Lightweight/Standard/Advanced)
- ✅ Environmental impact scoring (1-3 scale)
- ✅ Model accuracy filtering (50-95% threshold)
- ✅ Lightweight model (~23MB) enables mobile support
- ✅ Automated model dataset updates (daily via GitHub Actions)
- ✅ PWA with offline capability (installable on desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Full accessibility support

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP ✅ Complete
**Goals**: PWA with tiered recommendations and environmental scoring

**Achieved**:
- <1 second to recommendations (target was <30s)
- 7 AI task categories with 98.3% classification accuracy
- ~40KB bundle size (target was <2MB)
- Full accessibility support
- Mobile & desktop PWA support

### Phase 2: v1.1 (In Progress)
**Goals**: Enhanced data quality and expanded features

- 📋 Additional task categories
- 📋 Improved accuracy data: Extract real metrics from model cards
- 📋 Cross-browser support: Firefox, Safari testing
- 📋 Community features: User feedback mechanisms

### Future Phases
- **v2.0**: Advanced filtering and comparison features
- **v3.0**: API integrations for real-time data

## Technical Architecture

```
User Input → Embedding Classification (MiniLM) → Model Selection → Environmental Scoring → Recommendations
```

**Fallback Chain**: Embedding Similarity → Semantic Matching → Keyword Matching → Default Category

## Success Metrics
- **Speed**: <1 second query to recommendation ✅
- **Accuracy**: 98.3% classification accuracy ✅
- **Performance**: ~40KB bundle, <1s load time ✅
- **Mobile Ready**: ~23MB model, PWA installable ✅
- **Adoption**: Target 1000+ monthly users by end 2025
